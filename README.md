# A simple Typescript quickstart

A simple Typescript quickstart using:

- Rollup for builds
- Jest for testing and coverage
- Nodemon for hot reloading
- ESLint for syntax rules
- Prettier for formatting

## Usage

Clone the repo as a quickstart with

`git clone https://github.com/jafayer/ts-starter.git <your-project-name>`

Then run the fresh start script to configure the package.json with your project's
